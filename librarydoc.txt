DESCRIPTION
    Pymetar is a python module and command line tool designed to fetch Metar
    reports from the NOAA (http://www.noaa.gov) and allow access to the
    included weather information.

CLASSES
    exceptions.Exception(exceptions.BaseException)
        EmptyIDException
        EmptyReportException
        NetworkException
    ReportFetcher
    ReportParser
    WeatherReport
    
    class EmptyIDException(exceptions.Exception)
     |  This gets thrown when the ReportFetcher is called with an empty ID
    
    class EmptyReportException(exceptions.Exception)
     |  This gets thrown when the ReportParser gets fed an empty report
    
    class NetworkException(exceptions.Exception)
     |  This gets thrown when a network error occurs
    
    class ReportFetcher
     |  Fetches a report from a given METAR id, optionally taking into
     |  account a different baseurl and using environment var-specified 
     |  proxies.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  FetchReport(self, StationCode=None, proxy=None)
     |      Fetch a report for a given station ID from the baseurl given
     |      upon creation of the ReportFetcher instance.
     |      If proxy is not None, a proxy URL of the form
     |      protocol://user:password@host.name.tld:port/
     |      is expected, for example:
     |      http://squid.somenet.com:3128/
     |      If no proxy is specified, the environment variable http_proxy 
     |      is inspected. If it isn't set, a direct connection is tried.
     |  
     |  GetReport(self)
     |      Get a previously fetched report again
     |  
     |  MakeReport(self, StationID, RawReport)
     |      Take a string (RawReport) and a station code and turn it
     |      into an object suitable for ReportParser
     |  
     |  __init__(self, MetarStationCode=None, baseurl='http://weather.noaa.gov/pub/data/observations/metar/decoded/')
     |      Set stationid attribute and base URL to fetch report from
    
    class ReportParser
     |  Parse raw METAR data from a WeatherReport object into actual 
     |  values and return the object with the values filled in.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  ParseReport(self, MetarReport=None)
     |      Take report with raw info only and return it with in 
     |      parsed values filled in. Note: This function edits the
     |      WeatherReport object you supply!
     |  
     |  __init__(self, MetarReport=None)
     |      Set attribute Report as specified on instantation.
     |  
     |  extractCloudInformation(self)
     |      Extract cloud information. Return None or a tuple (sky type as a
     |      string of text and suggested pixmap name)
     |  
     |  extractSkyConditions(self)
     |      Extract sky condition information from the encoded report. Return 
     |      a tuple containing the description of the sky conditions as a 
     |      string and a suggested pixmap name for an icon representing said 
     |      sky condition.
     |  
     |  match_WeatherPart(self, regexp)
     |      Return the matching part of the encoded Metar report.  
     |      regexp: the regexp needed to extract this part.  
     |      Return the first matching string or None.  
     |      WARNING: Some Metar reports may contain several matching 
     |      strings, only the first one is taken into account!
    
    class WeatherReport
     |  Incorporates both the unparsed textual representation of the
     |  weather report and the parsed values as soon as they are filled 
     |  in by ReportParser.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __init__(self, MetarStationCode=None)
     |      Clear all fields and fill in wanted station id.
     |  
     |  getCycle(self)
     |      Return cycle value.
     |      The cycle value is not the frequency or delay between 
     |      observations but the "time slot" in which the observation was made. 
     |      There are 24 cycle slots every day which usually last from N:45 to 
     |      N+1:45. The cycle from 23:45 to 0:45 is cycle 0.

     |  
     |  getPixmap(self)

     |  getStationLatitude(self)
     |      Return the station's latitude in dd-mm[-ss]D format :
     |      dd : degrees
     |      mm : minutes
     |      ss : seconds
     |      D : direction (N, S, E, W)
     |  
     |  getStationLatitudeFloat(self)
     |      Return latitude as a float
     |  
     |  getStationLongitude(self)
     |      Return the station's longitude in dd-mm[-ss]D format :
     |      dd : degrees
     |      mm : minutes
     |      ss : seconds
     |      D : direction (N, S, E, W)
     |  
     |  getStationLongitudeFloat(self)
     |      Return Longitude as a float
     |  
     |  getStationName(self)
     |      Return full station name
     |  
     |  getStationPosition(self)
     |      Return latitude, longitude and altitude above sea level of station
     |      as a tuple. Some stations don't deliver altitude, for those, None 
     |      is returned as altitude.  The lat/longs are expressed as follows:
     |      xx-yyd
     |      where xx is degrees, yy minutes and d the direction.
     |      Thus 51-14N means 51 degrees, 14 minutes north.  d may take the 
     |      values N, S for latitues and W, E for longitudes. Latitude and 
     |      Longitude may include seconds.  Altitude is always given as meters 
     |      above sea level, including a trailing M.
     |      Schipohl Int. Airport Amsterdam has, for example:
     |      ('52-18N', '004-46E', '-2M')
     |      Moenchengladbach (where I live):
     |      ('51-14N', '063-03E', None)
     |      If you need lat and long as float values, look at 
     |      getStationPositionFloat() instead
     |  
     |  getStationPositionFloat(self)
     |      Return latitude and longitude as float values in a 
     |      tuple (lat, long, alt).

     |      is *not* the time when the report was fetched by us
     |      Format:  YYYY.MM.DD HHMM UTC
     |      Example: 2002.04.01 1020 UTC
